# piet-interpreters
My work-in-progress on making more usable Piet interpreters.

When learning about the Piet language I noticed that, well, the offline interpreters seem to be in rather *varied* shape. 

As such, I wanted to try writing my own eventually in a variety of languages because that's how I work. 

I'll be updating this repo as I go and I'll try to leave notes about things I've learned about implementing such an odd but cool little language!
